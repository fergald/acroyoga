# Acroyoga in Tokyo

## What's this page?

It's a list of the regular public acroyoga jams/classes in Tokyo.
I made it because I sometimes send this kind of info
to people who are new to acro or new to Tokyo.
Now I can just send them this link.

## Feedback
If you want something added or changed
or just have a suggestion

## Regular Classes/Jams

Tokyo has a few regular classes and jams.
The list here is all that I know of.
There are some private or invitaton-only jams.
I don't list them here.
Occasionally I organize a jam on public holidays.
I always post this on the AcroYoga Facebook group (below).

Everything below welcomes all levels.

All of the teachers below are available for private lessons,
please contact them directly for more information.

The order is random every time you load the page
because they are all great
and they should all be first sometimes!

- **Acroyoyogis** - a daytime outdoor jam at the [big pine tree in Yoyogi park](https://goo.gl/maps/hjEZAWaZSV5nrmCF8).
  Usually every Sunday,
  hosted by Matt.
  Events are posted on [Acroyoyogis Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/acroyoyogis).
- **SOGO AcroYoga Jam** - a night-time jam.
  Usually Tue or Wed,
  hosted by Daniel Norris.
  The location varies.
  In the summer it is often in a park.
  In the winter it is usually in a community hall or sports complex.

  Details on [Acroyoga Freedom Tokyo Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/acroyogafreedomtokyo/).
  That page might only have Japanese
  but Akiko speaks English,
  so you can DM.
  You can attend class or jam or both.

## Online resources

One-off events and some regular events
are usually posted to the [AcroYoga Tokyo Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/acroyoga.tokyo).
This group is less active
since the pandemic
but is still a good group to join
if you want to do acroyoga in Tokyo
as a visitor or resident.
