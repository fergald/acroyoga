# Acroyoga in Tokyo

## What's this page?

It's a list of the regular public acroyoga jams/classes in Tokyo.
I made it because I sometimes send this kind of info
to people who are new to acro or new to Tokyo.
Now I can just send them this link.

If you want something added or changed
please send me a chat or email acro AT fergaldaly.com .

## Regular Classes/Jams

Tokyo has a few regular classes and jams.
The list here is all that I know of.
There are some private or invitaton-only jams.
I don't list them here.
Occasionally I organize a jam on public holidays.
I always post this on the AcroYoga Facebook group (below).

Everything below welcomes all levels.

## Online resources

One-off events and some regular events
are usually posted to the [AcroYoga Tokyo Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/acroyoga.tokyo).
This group is less active
since the pandemic
but is still a good group to join
if you want to do acroyoga in Tokyo
as a visitor or resident.
