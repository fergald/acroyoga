# Acroyoga in Tokyo

[日本語](tokyo-ja.html)

## What's this page?

It's a list of the regular public acroyoga jams/classes in Tokyo.
I made it because I sometimes send this kind of info
to people who are new to acro or new to Tokyo.
Now I can just send them this link.

## Feedback
If you want something added or changed
or just have a suggestion

## Language

All of the teachers listed below can work in English and Japanese.

## Regular Classes/Jams

Tokyo has a few regular classes and jams.
The list here is all that I know of.
There are some private or invitaton-only jams.
I don't list them here.
Occasionally I organize a jam on public holidays.
I always post this on the AcroYoga Facebook group (below).

Everything below welcomes all levels.

All of the teachers below are available for private lessons,
please contact them directly for more information.

In weekday, order Monday-Sunday.

## Online resources

One-off events and some regular events
are usually posted to the [AcroYoga Tokyo Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/acroyoga.tokyo).
This group is less active
since the pandemic
but is still a good group to join
if you want to do acroyoga in Tokyo
as a visitor or resident.
